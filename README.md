# Concept:
---
To build a `REST` API using a `ORM` with the `sequelize` package from `npm`, following the `MSC` architecture:

 - Create and join tables using `models` from `sequelize`
 - Build endpoints to consume the created models
 - Make a `CRUD` with the `ORM`
 - Logic validations made with [Joi](https://joi.dev/api/)
 - Authentication made with [JWT](https://jwt.io/)

#### Still a work in progress with room for refactoring. As I learn, I plan to continue implementing and optimizing best practices and design patterns.

## How to start it:
